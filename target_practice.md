### Task
The task we were given was to find the real name of the person using the username `anonhunter26`

### Solution
The first step to take is to find out any information we can about anonhunter26. One way of doing this is to use a tool that looks up usernames. The one I used was What's My Name at https://whatsmyname.app/. That gave a link to a twitter account with the same username. In one of anonhunter26's tweets they mention a coworker with the username hatebav2ropc.
